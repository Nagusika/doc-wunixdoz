# Abstract
For reasons of my own, I am forced to work with a machine running Windows, and I have to set aside my old habits as a happy hipster and return to a mess of windows everywhere, mouse control, and a set of unbearable keyboard shortcuts that are of no interest to me.

I will make sure to compile in this document the setup of a bearded environment as we like it, to hide the shame of having to use OSs that think for us.

Nothing new, many existing projects now allow us to set up a really nice environment (like Sway/i3), get rid of/replace the native shortcuts and use the Windows key for something other than opening an advertisement menu for Edge,

and have, like on our dear *nix, an environment in which we think we are the master, shaky but it will impress my mother and the new intern.

goodbye Alacritty hello Windows Terminal and VScode, I am a new man!

Welcome to my Winxdoz!

# Environment

## Windows Native tools
 - Windows 11
 - Winget (what Windows have a packet manager !?)
 - WSL (ubuntu22.04 but use your favorite flavor)
 - Windows Terminal
 - VSCode

## third party tools

Rest assured, we will avoid installing "Windows-style" junk with poorly licensed and "beautifully" coded in C++++.

No, no, no, we stick to a minimum of rules: CopyLeft Friendly, Rust because this fashion has taste, and if possible maintainable through Winget (but not always, sry).
